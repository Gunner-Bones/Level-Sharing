# Level-Sharing
 
A WIP Idea for a Geometry Dash tool. This project only works locally at the moment, whereas the intended design is to work by sharing
levels across a server. 

## Installation
This requires Python 3.7 or higher.
Make sure you also have the Python module `psutil`.
To install it, open a **Command Prompt** and type:
```
pip install psutil
```

To run the program, simply run `main.py` with the command:
```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage
Follow the instructions on the application to Upload or Download a level.
For the prompts that require loading a saved level, make sure:
1) The level is on the top of your Created Levels list
2) Your game client is closed when you load the level.
